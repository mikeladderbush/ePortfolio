# Self Reflection
  As I reflect on my journey through the SNHU Computer Science program and the development of my ePortfolio, I am confident in the growth and readiness I have gained to pursue a career in the field of computer science. Throughout my coursework, I have not only acquired technical knowledge but also honed essential skills that are crucial for success in today's competitive tech industry.
One of the most significant aspects of my development has been in understanding the value of different perspectives in the creation of robust code-bases. Through various classes and assignments, I have learned to effectively communicate and coordinate with diverse classmates who tackle problems from different angles. Gaining an understanding of how to apply best-practices and use a developer's mindset has also been a key area of my growth. I have developed the ability to articulate technical concepts clearly and concisely and implement them in my work in a way that is readable and functionally sound.

  In terms of technical skills, my coursework has equipped me with a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms. Beyond mastering fundamental concepts such as arrays, linked lists, and trees, I have applied this knowledge practically in developing efficient algorithms and optimizing code performance. For instance, in my C++ application project, I implemented data structures like hashmaps to enhance the efficiency of data retrieval and manipulation, demonstrating both my understanding of data structures and practical problem-solving abilities. I have also gained hands-on experience in maintaining and improving web applications. This was evident in my first and third artifacts, where I developed back-end components and a database to add functionality to a simple application.

  The artifacts included in my ePortfolio showcase a diverse range of technical skills and accomplishments. From the implementation of complex algorithms to the development of scalable software applications, each artifact represents a milestone in my academic journey and highlights my ability to tackle real-world challenges in computer science.
In summary, my professional self-assessment serves as a testament to my growth, competence, and readiness to embark on a career in computer science. I am excited about the opportunity to use my skills and knowledge in future roles, contributing meaningfully to innovative projects and teams within the industry.
