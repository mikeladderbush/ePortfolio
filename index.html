        <h2>Professional Reflection</h2>
        <p>As I reflect on my journey through the SNHU Computer Science program and the development of my ePortfolio, I am confident in the growth and readiness I have gained to pursue a career in the field of computer science. Throughout my coursework, I have not only acquired technical knowledge but also honed essential skills that are crucial for success in today's competitive tech industry. One of the most significant aspects of my development has been in understanding the value of different perspectives in the creation of robust code-bases. Through various classes and assignments, I have learned to effectively communicate and coordinate with diverse classmates who tackle problems from different angles. Gaining an understanding of how to apply best-practices and use a developer's mindset has also been a key area of my growth. I have developed the ability to articulate technical concepts clearly and concisely and implement them in my work in a way that is readable and functionally sound.

In terms of technical skills, my coursework has equipped me with a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms. Beyond mastering fundamental concepts such as arrays, linked lists, and trees, I have applied this knowledge practically in developing efficient algorithms and optimizing code performance. For instance, in my C++ application project, I implemented data structures like hashmaps to enhance the efficiency of data retrieval and manipulation, demonstrating both my understanding of data structures and practical problem-solving abilities. I have also gained hands-on experience in maintaining and improving web applications. This was evident in my first and third artifacts, where I developed back-end components and a database to add functionality to a simple application.

The artifacts included in my ePortfolio showcase a diverse range of technical skills and accomplishments. From the implementation of complex algorithms to the development of scalable software applications, each artifact represents a milestone in my academic journey and highlights my ability to tackle real-world challenges in computer science. In summary, my professional self-assessment serves as a testament to my growth, competence, and readiness to embark on a career in computer science. I am excited about the opportunity to use my skills and knowledge in future roles, contributing meaningfully to innovative projects and teams within the industry.</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Java Application Enhancements (<a href="https://github.com/mikeladderbush/ePortfolio/tree/main/BjjSite" target="_blank">here</a>)</h3>
        <p>    I selected this artifact because it represents a comprehensive Java application that I developed to manage contacts, appointments, and tasks. It showcases my proficiency in Java programming and object-oriented design, which are fundamental skills in software development. By enhancing this artifact, I aimed to demonstrate my ability to iteratively improve and extend a software project based on changing requirements and objectives. In Module One, I focused on enhancing the functionality related to managing appointments and tasks. Specifically, I wanted to implement functionality to allow contacts to relate to and contain appointments and for appointments to do the same with tasks. I also wanted this feature to associate contacts, appointments and tasks with one another while ensuring that objects remained unique and did not get added to others that didnâ€™t match IDs. I wanted my services, suppliers and objects to generate unique objects with descriptive variables that could be expanded upon easily in the future. I plan to further improve this artifact by adding REST Apis that can be served to a frontend application and by improving the current project this goal can be accomplished more easily in the future. This enhancement required an understanding of class relationships, dependency management, and proper object orientation. Through this process, I demonstrated skills in object-oriented design by carefully considering class relationships and encapsulation to ensure a clean and maintainable design. I managed dependencies between classes effectively, ensuring that each class encapsulates its responsibilities and interacts with other classes through well-defined interfaces. This approach promotes modularity and code reusability. Overall, enhancing this artifact allowed me to showcase my skills in software development, particularly in Java programming, object-oriented design, problem-solving, and testing. It reflects my ability to analyze requirements, design robust solutions, and iteratively improve software projects.</p>
        <h3>Enhanced Linked List (<a href="https://github.com/mikeladderbush/ePortfolio/tree/main/Artifact%202/src target="_blank">here</a>)</h3>
        <p>    The artifact I chose to enhance for my ePortfolio was a linked list implementation I developed for my CS-300 class. These enhancements included the implementation of a hashmap data structure, refactoring for improved modularity, and the addition of comprehensive documentation. These improvements reflect a commitment to mastering data structures and algorithms while also emphasizing best practices in software design and development. This artifact will be included in the ePortfolio because of its substantial enhancements and its demonstration of data structure implementation. By extending the project to include a hashmap and refactoring the codebase, the artifact shows that I have the capability to adapt and expand upon existing code to meet evolving requirements and relates to the course objectives of demonstrating computer science techniques and using them effectively. The emphasis on comprehensive documentation highlights the importance of communication and documentation practices in software development, aligning with the course objectives of building cooperation and communicating professionally. Refactoring the codebase provided an opportunity to deepen my understanding of code organization, readability, and maintainability. Implementing the hashmap required consideration of data storage and retrieval strategies, leading to improvements in efficiency. The addition of comprehensive documentation not only enhanced clarity and accessibility for developers and users but also shows the importance of effective communication in software engineering. Overall, the enhancement process helped to build a deeper understanding of data structures and essential software engineering skills.</p>
