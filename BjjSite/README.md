# Artifact 1

I selected this artifact because it represents a comprehensive Java application that I developed to manage contacts, appointments, and tasks. It showcases my proficiency in Java programming and object-oriented design, which are fundamental skills in software development. By enhancing this artifact, I aimed to demonstrate my ability to iteratively improve and extend a software project based on changing requirements and objectives.
In Module One, I focused on enhancing the functionality related to managing appointments and tasks. Specifically, I wanted to implement functionality to allow contacts to relate to and contain appointments and for appointments to do the same with tasks. I also wanted this feature to associate contacts, appointments and tasks with one another while ensuring that objects remained unique and did not get added to others that didnâ€™t match IDs. I wanted my services, suppliers and objects to generate unique objects with descriptive variables that could be expanded upon easily in the future. I plan to further improve this artifact by adding REST Apis that can be served to a frontend application and by improving the current project this goal can be accomplished more easily in the future. This enhancement required an understanding of class relationships, dependency management, and proper object orientation.
Through this process, I demonstrated skills in object-oriented design by carefully considering class relationships and encapsulation to ensure a clean and maintainable design. I managed dependencies between classes effectively, ensuring that each class encapsulates its responsibilities and interacts with other classes through well-defined interfaces. This approach promotes modularity and code reusability. Overall, enhancing this artifact allowed me to showcase my skills in software development, particularly in Java programming, object-oriented design, problem-solving, and testing. It reflects my ability to analyze requirements, design robust solutions, and iteratively improve software projects.

# Artifact 3

The artifact I chose to enhance for my ePortfolio was a linked list implementation I developed for my CS-300 class. These enhancements included the implementation of a hashmap data structure, refactoring for improved modularity, and the addition of comprehensive documentation. These improvements reflect a commitment to mastering data structures and algorithms while also emphasizing best practices in software design and development.
This artifact will be included in the ePortfolio because of its substantial enhancements and its demonstration of data structure implementation. By extending the project to include a hashmap and refactoring the codebase, the artifact shows that I have the capability to adapt and expand upon existing code to meet evolving requirements and relates to the course objectives of demonstrating computer science techniques and using them effectively. The emphasis on comprehensive documentation highlights the importance of communication and documentation practices in software development, aligning with the course objectives of building cooperation and communicating professionally.
Refactoring the codebase provided an opportunity to deepen my understanding of code organization, readability, and maintainability. Implementing the hashmap required consideration of data storage and retrieval strategies, leading to improvements in efficiency. The addition of comprehensive documentation not only enhanced clarity and accessibility for developers and users but also shows the importance of effective communication in software engineering. Overall, the enhancement process helped to build a deeper understanding of data structures and essential software engineering skills.
